- Task '12' from project 'P2' delayed by 60 days due to insufficient availability of resource 'R10'.
- Task '14' from project 'P2' delayed by 30 days due to insufficient availability of resource 'R11'.
- Task '15' from project 'P2' delayed by 95 days due to insufficient availability of resource 'R11'.
- Task '14' from project 'P1' delayed by 165 days due to insufficient availability of resource 'R12'.
- Task '9' from project 'P3' delayed by 157 days due to insufficient availability of resource 'R12'.
- Task '13' from project 'P3' delayed by 75 days due to insufficient availability of resource 'R10'.
- Task '53' from project 'P1' delayed by 284 days due to insufficient availability of resource 'R9'.

2. Report of Projects when resources are a constraint:
The report provides an overview of the projects when the availability of resources is a constraint. It includes details such as project delivery status, penalties, construction phase duration, and water consumption. The projects analyzed are as follows:

- Project 'P1' was delivered late by 109 labor days, on 03-06-2026. The deadline was 01-01-2026. The total penalty is 54.5 k$.
  - Construction phase: Initial date: 22-05-2024, End date: 27-05-2026. Duration: 525 labor days. Total water consumption: 131,250 m3.

- Project 'P2' was delivered late by 104 labor days, on 27-05-2026. The deadline was 01-01-2026. The total penalty is 72.8 k$.
  - Construction phase: Initial date: 23-01-2025, End date: 20-05-2026. Duration: 344 labor days. Total water consumption: 86,000 m3.

- Project 'P3' was delivered late by 351 labor days, on 08-05-2028. The deadline was 01-01-2027. The total penalty is 315.9 k$.
  - Construction phase: Initial date: 20-05-2025, End date: 25-02-2028. Duration: 723 labor days. Total water consumption: 180,750 m3.

3. Report of Projects not constrained by resources:
The report also presents an analysis of the projects when resources are not considered a limiting factor. It includes project delivery status, penalties, construction phase duration, and water consumption. The projects analyzed are as follows:

- Project 'P1' was delivered on time on 12-08-2024. There is no penalty.
  - Construction phase: Initial date: 04-01-2024, End date: 05-08-2024. Duration: 152 labor days. Total water consumption: 38,000 m3.

- Project 'P2' was delivered on time on 12-12-2025. There is no penalty.
  - Construction phase: Initial date: 12-08-2024, End date: 05-12-2025. Duration: 344 labor days. Total water consumption: 86,000 m3.

- Project 'P3' was delivered late by 92 labor days, on 11-05-2027. The deadline was 01-01-2027. The total penalty is 82.8 k$.
  - Construction phase: Initial date: 22-05-2024, End date: 01-03-2027. Duration: 723 labor days. Total water consumption: 180,750 m3.

Insights and Recommendations:
Based on the data and analysis provided, it is evident that resource constraints have a significant impact on project delivery. Projects under resource constraints experience delays and penalties, resulting in financial and time losses.

To maximize overall project efficiency and minimize delays, the following resources should be increased:

- Resource 'R1': Insufficient availability of this resource is causing delays in multiple tasks and projects. Increasing its availability will help reduce delays and improve overall project performance.

- Resource 'R10' and 'R11': These resources are causing significant delays in tasks within project 'P2'. Increasing their availability will help mitigate these delays and ensure timely project delivery.

Considering the high penalties incurred due to delayed project delivery, it is essential for the portfolio manager to prioritize resource allocation and planning. By proactively addressing resource constraints and increasing the availability of key resources, the portfolio manager can minimize delays, penalties, and financial losses.

Additionally, it is important to monitor resource consumption during the construction phase, as excessive water consumption can impact sustainability and environmental goals. Implementing efficient resource management practices and exploring alternatives to reduce water consumption can contribute to the project's overall success.

In conclusion, resource constraints have a significant impact on project delivery, resulting in delays, penalties, and financial losses. By increasing the availability of key resources 'R1', 'R10', and 'R11', the portfolio manager can alleviate project delays and reduce financial risks. Additionally, monitoring and optimizing resource consumption, such as water usage, can uphold sustainability objectives.
